      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I’m an economist turned programmer, hiker, cook and fitness crazy head. I didn't grow up with computers and I didn't know how to properly use one until I was over 20
        and was writing my thesis for Bachelor's degree in Economics. I've come a long way since then. I've moved countries, got a degree in Computer Science,
        a full-time job as a developer, and every now and then I give tech talks (this usually happens when I forget how scary it is!). When I'm not at work I'm either at one
        of the events organised by [London Clojurians][2], at home doing something tech related, reading/watching/thinking, or getting my dose of nature.

        I like beer, films on a big screen, live music (of all sorts, with significant pull towards rock) and people who challenge me intellectually.
