      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I’m an economist turned programmer, hiker, cook and fitness crazy head. I didn't grow up with computers and I didn't know how to properly use one until I was over 20
        and was writing my thesis for Bachelor's degree in Economics. I've come a long way since then. I moved countries a couple of times (first England, and recently the USA), got a degree in Computer Science,
        a full-time job as a developer, and every now and then I give tech talks (this usually happens when I forget how scary it is!).

        I like board games, beer, films on a big screen, live music (of all sorts, with significant pull towards rock) and people who challenge me intellectually.
