After performing some experiments with Q-Learning algorithm, reading tons of research papers and finallyÂ realizing that evolving walking in Aibo is a research project on its own, I decided to change the simulation to e-puck.

e-puck is a differential wheels robot, kindly nicknamed &#8220;yoghurt pot&#8221; by my friends:

<span style="line-height: 1.6;">Why e-puck? Only two wheels to control (as opposed to 16 joints in Aibo). As a bonus, once the algorithm is completed I&#8217;ll have a chance to test it on a real robot!</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.6;">The algorithm I&#8217;m implementing is Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Network (CTRNN). It&#8217;s just a first step. Second step will be to evolve two populations: agents and games. Games will represent different fitness functions, agents &#8211; neural networks. I&#8217;m back to evolutionary computation.</span>
