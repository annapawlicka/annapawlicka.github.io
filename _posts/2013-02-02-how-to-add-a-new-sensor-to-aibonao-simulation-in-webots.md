Most of the robot simulations can be modified by adding Nodes directly in Scene Tree in Webots itself. However, to add a new sensor to Aibo (and NAO), we need to modify proto file. Example path on OS X (can differ from system to system):  
/Applications/Webots/resources/projects/robots/aibo/protos/Aibo_ERS7.proto

As anÂ example, to add a distance sensor we need to paste this into the file:

```
    DistanceSensor {
                   translation 0 0.03 -0.0146
                   rotation 0 0 1 -1.57
                   name "color_sensor"
                   lookupTable [ 0 0 0,
                                 0.1 500 0.1,
                                 0.2 250 0.1,
                                 0.3 50 0.1,
                                 0.37 30 0 ]
                   }
```
