I&#8217;ve been looking into online tutorials, books, online courses and anything else that can help with learning Clojure.

<!--more-->

This is what I&#8217;ve settled for (for now):

  * <span style="line-height: 15px;"><a href="http://www.manning.com/rathore/">&#8220;Clojure in Action&#8221;</a> &#8211; hands-on tutorial for programmers with OOP background. It touches on unit testing, Hadoop and DSLs too.</span>
  * [&#8220;The Joy of Clojure&#8221;][1]Â &#8211; more of a deep dive into the language. It teaches how to write idiomatic Clojure (in a style that best uses the language&#8217;s features).
  * [&#8220;Programming Clojure (2nd edition)&#8221;][2] &#8211; book that takes you through the language one step at a time. Plenty of practical examples.
  * [4Clojure][3] &#8211; learning the language through interactive problems, starting from elementary level where no prior experience is needed.

I will update the list if I come across more interesting resources, but do let me know if you know some yourself.
