Thanks to good people at <a title="Cognitect" href="http://cognitect.com/" target="_blank">Cognitect</a> and the sponsors of the Opportunity Grant I had an opportunity to speak at <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/" target="_blank">Clojure/conj 2014</a>. It was the second time I&#8217;ve given a talk, and a fourth tech conference I attended. And it&#8217;s been amazing!

The venue, Warner Theatre, is the most beautiful conference venue I&#8217;ve seen. Just look at this photo! It might have been a little cold, but nothing that hot coffee or tea wouldn&#8217;t fix.<figure style="width: 380px;" class="wp-caption alignleft">

The talks were awesome, speakers well prepared and approachable and organisers friendly and helpful. I&#8217;m very glad my talk was second on the first day as I could just sit back and take it all in. And there was a lot to take in. Eye-opening talk about data-driven systems by <a href="https://twitter.com/ohpauleez" target="_blank">Paul deGrandis</a>, brain melting introduction to persistent data structures by <a href="https://github.com/michalmarczyk" target="_blank">Michał Marczyk</a>, very educational talk about variants by <a href="https://twitter.com/jneen_" target="_blank">Jeanine Adkisson</a>, hilarious walk through game development by Zach Oakes, two amazing keynotes and lots of other talks left me with a long TODO list. There&#8217;s so much I want and need to learn and I&#8217;m very grateful to all speakers and attendees for sharing their knowledge and experiences. You can watch all talks on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZdCLR02grLoc322bYirANEso3mmzvCiI" target="_blank">Clojure TV</a> YouTube channel.

But as we all know people is what makes for a great conference. We can watch the talks online but we can&#8217;t talk to the speakers and other attendees, be challenged, go through &#8220;a-ha!&#8221; moments or have a small hackathon in the hotel lobby. We can&#8217;t make new friends and new interesting contacts. And being at Clojure/conj provided me with all the above. I&#8217;ve said it before, and I&#8217;m going to say it again: Clojure community is the friendliest community I&#8217;ve experienced. I felt very welcomed and supported both as a speaker and attendee. And I felt safe and treated like an equal. I truly hope other communities will follow in our footsteps because nothing inspires more than a room full of smart people who don&#8217;t try to prove their superiority but share their knowledge instead. We all have a common goal after all: improve technology, improve industry, improve our lives and ourselves.<figure id="attachment_404" style="width: 374px;" class="wp-caption alignright">

Dinner with the Lambda Ladies, sponsored by the kind people at <a href="https://www.livingsocial.com" target="_blank">Living Social</a> was a blast too! Lots of good advice and laughter &#8211; I hope it won&#8217;t be long before I see you again!

I&#8217;ve returned to London energised, with some great memories that I play on repeat in my head. I hope this state of mind will last a little longer or at least till the next event.

Thank you everyone who made Conj so memorable &#8211; I hope we meet again!
