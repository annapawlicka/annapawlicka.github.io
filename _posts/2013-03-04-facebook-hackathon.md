A week ago I attended Women in Computing Hackathon. Theme was &#8220;Health & Fitness&#8221;. Our team, &#8220;Cheetahs&#8221;, was working on an app called &#8220;Fittah Cheetah&#8221;.

In summary:  
&#8211; Setting up our development environment took us ages! Embarrassing..  
&#8211; Facebook engineers &#8211; über friendly people  
&#8211; Awesome office: loved the hammock  
&#8211; Great networking opportunity and great ideas  
&#8211; Food!

Things I took away from the event:  
1. I want to learn mobile development!  
2. &#8220;What would you do if you weren&#8217;t afraid?&#8221; slogan. It&#8217;s actually hanging above my desk.
