Everyone has their favourite editor/IDE &#8211; mine&#8217;s IntelliJ. Why?

  * **Debugging: Brilliant evaluation everywhere!**
  * **No saving files:** Seriously. You just don&#8217;t do it, they are autosaved.
  * **Shortcuts:** pure awesomeness. Also, if you happen to forget the shortcut of an action, just hit Command-Shift-A, and you’ll be prompted with an auto-complete search  box where you can search for actions and their shortcuts. Neat!
  * **Autocomplete &#8211; it e**ven suggests variable names and works well in EL, SQL, JPA etc.
  * **Unit Tests:** you can easily visually diff expected vs actual in unit tests.
  * Maven, Ant, Gradle integration

Overall, Intellij builds up a lot of knowledge about your application and then uses that knowledge to help you write better code, faster.

Wondering about the money? There&#8217;s fully functional Community Edition that&#8217;s free. And if you want to buy the paid version, JetBrains now offers [75% off][1].
