I’m an economist turned programmer, hiker, cook and fitness crazy head. I didn&#8217;t grow up with computers and I didn&#8217;t know how to properly use one until I was over 20 and was writing my thesis for Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Economics. I&#8217;ve come a long way since then. I&#8217;ve moved countries, got a degree in Computer Science, a full-time job as a developer, and every now and then I give tech talks (this usually happens when I forget how scary it is!). When I&#8217;m not at work I&#8217;m either at one of the events organised by [London Clojurians][2], at home doing something tech related, reading/watching/thinking, or getting my dose of nature.

I like beer, films on a big screen, live music (of all sorts, with significant pull towards rock) and people who challenge me intellectually.
